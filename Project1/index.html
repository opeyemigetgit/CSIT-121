        <h2>Hello, I'm Alexis!</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to my “Three Things” website! This is a website           about my top three hobbies. They are listening to music,             cooking, and creating art. These are not only things I do            in my spare time but also things that bring me joy both              alone and while sharing with other people. 
        </p>

        <p>If you enjoy any of these too and/or would like to discuss anything with me I will leave my email <a href="j.alexis.gray777@gmail.com" style="color:black">here</a></p>
