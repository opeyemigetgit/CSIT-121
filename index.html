	<p>Vegetale soup is a native soup in Nigeria, in my tribe(yoruba) we call it efo riro. I love the soup because it literally goes with anything for example: pounded yam, semo, fufuf, boilled white rice and eba(cassava). i have recomend it for lot of my America friends that have not tried it and they gave me a wonderful review on it. </p>
